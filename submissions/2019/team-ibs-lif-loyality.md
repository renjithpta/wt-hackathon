## Description

The idea is to try to create an ecosystem to use Lif for implementing Loyalty.

## Problems

As of now most of the loyalty points are associated with brands. Customer doesn't have the freedom of choice and loyalty can only be redeemed with in the brands choice.
 

## Solution

We provide freedom of choice to the customers by redeeming loyality points as Windingtree LIF and can create an eco system to make use of LIF to buy ancillary provided by Flights, Hotels or Retails. Conversion of  customer loyality point will be based on smart contact.

An offline model of loyalty transaction will be followed to reduced the transation cost.
